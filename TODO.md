TODOs
=====

This file captures the high level goals of the project. This provides guidance for anyone who wants
to contribute. If you see something in the list that you'd like to work on,
the best approach would be to [create an
issue](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-UniversalMusicPlayer/issues) first,
and then provide a pull request once completed to have your work merged into the project.
