         * Since all [MediaItemData]s have a unique ID, it's easiest to check if two
         * items are the same by simply comparing that ID.
         *
         * To check if the contents are the same, we use the same ID, but it may be the
         * case that it's only the play state itself which has changed (from playing to
         * paused, or perhaps a different item is the active item now). In this case
         * we check both the ID and the playback resource.
         *
         * To calculate the payload, we use the simplest method possible:
         * - Since the title, subtitle, and albumArtUri are constant (with respect to mediaId),
         *   there's no reason to check if they've changed. If the mediaId is the same, none of
         *   those properties have changed.
         * - If the playback resource (playbackRes) has changed to reflect the change in playback
         *   state, that's all that needs to be updated. We return [PLAYBACK_RES_CHANGED] as
         *   the payload in this case.
         * - If something else changed, then refresh the full item for simplicity.
