 * *** THERE IS USUALLY NO REASON TO USE THIS ***
 *
 * The purpose of "extra-settings.gradle" is to allow the use of a local version of the ExoPlayer
 * library to be used to build the project. This is useful for testing experimental features
 * which have not yet been released, extending the library yourself, or for debugging issues
 * with either ExoPlayer or the MediaSession extension.
 *
 * To make use of this, create a file named "extra-settings.gradle" in the root of the
 * project (along side settings.gradle) with the following contents:
 *
 * gradle.ext.exoplayerRoot = '<path_to_exoplayer>'
 * gradle.ext.exoplayerModulePrefix = 'exoplayer-'
 * apply from: new File(gradle.ext.exoplayerRoot, 'core_settings.gradle')
 *
 * For more information, see: https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/blob/release-v2/README.md
